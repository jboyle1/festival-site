						<p>We are Neighbourhood for Change, more specifically District 19!</p>
						<p>A group of Graphic Designers who are in their third and final year studying at Plymouth College of Art. As a collective, we believe in creating justice and changing people's lives for the better through design. We aim to help people that are in need and expose the social injustices we see everyday affecting communities across the UK.</p>
						<p>Our vision is to create a festival of change. A space for conversation, collaboration and a platform for people to share and inspire a generation of change. We will ensure that our festival will be a safe space, a Neighbourhood; where a variety of social injustices can be brought to light.
