## Name of Project: Neighbourhood for change (website)

The Neighbourhood for Change website is a project for my final year at university. Our individual FMP projects will be showcased in a festival for social justice we ourselves organised. Everything from the branding to the logistics. My role was to develop the website which I enjoyed. From my perspective the whole festival module came together well. This was an insightful experience giving me a sense of what it would be like in a graphic design agency. Having such a central role (the web developer) gave me a stand point were I could interact with everyone, a good chance to work as a team.
