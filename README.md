## Name of Project: Neighbourhood for change (website)

I was asked to design a website to showcase ceramic artwork for Sculptor Jackie Summerfield. This is an exciting project which 
will expand my skills as a web developer. Jackie needs an online central hub that displays her work that also links to her 
social media. This is a marketing decision that will turn her followers into potential clients. The goal is to develop a 
professional looking, clean designed, easy to navigate portfolio site that will provide potential clients with an overview of 
her talents and a way to contact her for commissions.
